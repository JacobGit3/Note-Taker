  ## Description

  ---
  This project allows the user to create small notes with a title and text and and delete button to keep tasks organized. I was unable to get a functioning product with the started code however the get and post requests are functional but the delete route is not. The program should add notes to the side bar to click on and see the text or to delete later however I was unable to get the notes from the stored data file to add to the page.
